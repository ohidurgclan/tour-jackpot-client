                            <p>I always a little nervous about booking a trip on line but everything worked out perfect. We were picked up at our hotel promptly and they arrived with a large Mercedes Benz caravan to take us to Siem Reap. The ride was conformable and in the heat the air conditioner was very powerful.</p>
