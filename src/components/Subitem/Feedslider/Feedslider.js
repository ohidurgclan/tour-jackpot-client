                        <p>I recently used Audley Travel for a trip to Australia and New Zealand. The destination is great. Regarding Audley, the hotels and most excursions were good. However, you choose a travel agency for help with the logistics--easy directions, smooth travel, etc.</p>

                        <p>We recently used Winter Park Escapes to book a property. The property was in a total state of disrepair and we had to call maintenance FIVE times. When we complained, they offered to refund 1/2 of one day. Donâ€™t use Winter Park Escapes!</p>

                        <p>I always a little nervous about booking a trip on line but everything worked out perfect. We were picked up at our hotel promptly and they arrived with a large Mercedes Benz caravan to take us to Siem Reap. The ride was conformable and in the heat the air conditioner was very powerful.</p>
